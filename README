This is a command-line tool to archive a GMail account to a local Maildir++ directory
structure. The initial version was written by Anders Pakulat.

This tool is licensed under the "Simplified BSD License", see LICENSE for details.

Pygmailarchive downloads all mails from your GMail account via IMAP, storing them in the
same structure as they are presented on the IMAP server. This means all your labels and
sub-labels will be converted into Maildir folders in the destination folder.

You can include or exclude certain labels or even a complete label-hierarchy easily.
This is useful for people having lists or emails that are already archived elsewhere.

Subsequent executions of the tool will download all mails that haven't been fetched so
far; the tool keeps a list of 'already seen mails' using a special index file stored
inside the Maildir++ structure.

The main intent is to copy the Mails from gmail to your own machine to archive or backup
them. This package can also be easily integrated into other software that need gmail
retrieval functionality.

Requirements:
 * Python 2.7
 * IMAPClient (http://imapclient.freshfoo.com/)

Example of how to use:
gmailarchive -u username -p password -a gmailarchive
