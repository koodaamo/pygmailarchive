This is a command-line tool to archive a GMail account to a local Maildir++ directory
structure. The initial version was written by Anders Pakulat. The tool is licensed under
the "Simplified BSD License", see LICENSE for details.

The main intent is to copy the Mails from gmail to your own machine to archive or backup
them. This package can also be easily integrated into other software that need gmail
retrieval functionality.

Mail is downloaded from your GMail account via IMAP, and messages are stored in the
same structure as is presented by the IMAP server. This means all your labels and
sub-labels will be converted into Maildir folders in the destination folder.

Subsequent executions of the tool will download all mails that haven't been fetched so
far; the tool keeps a list of 'already seen mails' using a special index file stored
inside the Maildir++ structure.

You can include or exclude certain gmail labels (IMAP folders) or even a complete
label-hierarchy easily. This is useful for people having lists or emails that are
already archived elsewhere, or for archiving certain lists or emails only.

Requirements:
 * Python 2.7
 * IMAPClient (http://imapclient.freshfoo.com/)

Example of how to use:
gmailarchive -u username -p password -a gmailarchive
